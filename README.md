This program is made to predict the future heart attack occurance of patients with heart problem. This program take values from their test reports to predict the outcome.
Please dont judge the pogram on based of accuracy as in this case/domain problem we need to reduce the false negatives not false positives so less accuray is acceptable rest i have mentioned every point within the code but if any of you have any problem with the code i am happy to answer those. Thankyou
